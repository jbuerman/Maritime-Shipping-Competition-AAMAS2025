Welcome to the Maritime Shipping Competition (MSC) at the 24th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS 2025).
Participating in the competition requires you to design a software agent that applies innovative ideas for auction bidding and transport scheduling to simulate a maritime transport company.
Participating allows you to compete for three performance-based prices and an innovative idea price.

Maritime transportation is one of the backbones of international trade and supply chains.
While the sector has shown growth in recent years, maritime transportation is also facing critical challenges around geopolitical tensions, climate change and disruptions at key chokepoints, e.g. the Panama and the Suez Canals.
Shipping companies are investigating digital solutions, including digital twin and multi-agent technologies, to improve fleet utilisation, e.g. via transportation scheduling, to reduce costs but also greenhouse gas emissions.
Many of these digital solutions are in their infancy and could benefit from innovative applications of approaches from multiagent system, artificial intelligence and related technologies.

Are you a researcher or practitioner interested in better maritime transportation and/or experienced in any of the approached and want to compete for the price, then read on.

If you would like to participate, please fill in [this form](https://forms.office.com/e/FwzZczMtM1){:target="_blank"} to pre-register and receive a group number.
