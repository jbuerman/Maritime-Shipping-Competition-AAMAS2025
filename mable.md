MABLE is an agent-based maritime cargo transportation simulator written in Python that only needs a few steps to be set up.
Please follow the setup guide, which also includes instructions on the required data files.
Once such a setting is specified and run, the simulator generates random cargo transportation opportunities that shipping companies can bid for to transport and then have to be transported from one port to another.
